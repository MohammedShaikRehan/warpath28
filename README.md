## **About Me**
Hi! I‚Äôm **Mohammed Shaik Rehan (Rehan)**, a first-year B.Sc Data Science student from Bangalore, India.  
Over the last **2‚Äì3 months**, I‚Äôve completed an **intensive hands-on learning journey**, which I call **‚ÄúWarpath‚Äù**.  

I combined **daily mini-projects**, **weekly big projects**, and **FCC Certification projects** to master **Python-based data analytics, visualization, and foundational AI/ML concepts**.

---

## **Full Learning Journey**

### **Phase 1 ‚Äì Intensive Foundations**
- **Python:** Syntax, file handling, functions, OOP, classes, constructors, method overloading  
- **NumPy:** Arrays, indexing, vectorized operations, math functions  
- **Pandas:** DataFrames, Series, cleaning, transformations, merges  
- **SQL:** Queries, joins, filtering, aggregations, basic schema knowledge  
- **Seaborn:** Statistical plots, heatmaps, pairplots, distribution plots  
- **Matplotlib:** Line, bar, scatter, histogram plots, customized visualizations  
- **Tableau:** Dashboards, business analytics visualizations  

*Mini Projects:* Small hands-on exercises every 2 days to reinforce skills  

### **Phase 2 ‚Äì Weekly Big Projects**
- **Week 1‚Äì4 Projects:** Real-world datasets, EDA, pivot tables, charts, and dashboards  
- Skills applied: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Excel, Tableau  

### **Phase 3 ‚Äì FCC Certification Projects**
1. **Medical Data Visualizer** ‚Äì Cleaned and visualized medical data using Seaborn  
2. **Page View Time Series Visualizer** ‚Äì Analyzed freeCodeCamp forum page views with line plots, bar charts, and box plots  
3. **Sea Level Predictor** ‚Äì Predicted global sea level rise using linear regression and plotted projections  
4. **Demographic Analyzer** ‚Äì Explored demographic datasets, performed EDA, and visualized population statistics  
5. **Time Series Visualizer** ‚Äì Visualized trends over time with line plots, bar charts, and box plots

## **My Thoughts**
This journey was **intense**. I started highly motivated, but as the weeks progressed, motivation naturally faded.  
The only thing that carried me forward every day was **discipline**.  

It would be a lie to say I showed up **100% of the time**, but the number of days I skipped could be counted on one hand.  

I pushed my limits, completing projects and notes that gave me **solid hands-on experience**.  
I don‚Äôt claim to retain 100% of what I learned, but I‚Äôve built enough practical knowledge to confidently **analyze data and visualize insights**.  
**Revision and continuous practice will keep me sharp.**

## **Skills Gained**

**Data Science & Tools**
- Python foundations (syntax, file handling, functions)  
- NumPy (arrays, indexing, vectorized operations, math functions)  
- Pandas (DataFrames, Series, cleaning, transformations, merges)  
- Seaborn (statistical plots, heatmaps, pairplots, distribution plots)  
- Matplotlib (custom visualizations, line/bar/scatter/histograms)  
- SQL (queries, joins, filtering, aggregations, schema basics)  
- Tableau (dashboards, data visualization, business analytics use)  

**ü§ñ AI / ML Side (Initial Layers)**
- Machine Learning basics (algorithms overview, regression, classification)  
- Math foundations starting (linear algebra, probability touchpoints)

## **Next Steps**
Well, **I am not stopping here**. I plan to launch another Warpath a **much bigger one called ‚ÄúAI Mastery‚Äù** where I aim to **master AI within 3‚Äì4 months** with the same intensity of projects, notes, and certifications.  

This next journey might take a bit longer because college will start soon, but I am fully committed to **learning AI deeply and mastering it**.
