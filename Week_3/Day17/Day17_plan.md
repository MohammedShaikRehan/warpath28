# Day 17 – SQL Window Functions & Ranking Logic

> *Today I prepared to learn advanced SQL topics like ranking rows, segmenting data, and performing calculations across rows without collapsing the dataset.*

## Sections planned:
1. Introduction to Window Functions  
2. ROW_NUMBER(), RANK(), DENSE_RANK()  
3. PARTITION BY  
4. ORDER BY inside OVER()  
5. Cumulative & Moving Aggregates  
6. LEAD() & LAG()  
7. NTILE()

## Reason for delay:
Worked intensely on Day 16 (Joins, Subqueries, Unions) — needed rest. Day 17 content previewed and scheduled for full completion tomorrow.
