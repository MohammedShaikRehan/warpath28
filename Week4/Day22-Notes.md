 DAY 22 LOG â€“ MATH + TABLEAU

ðŸ§  WHY I STARTED HERE:
I decided to start math from the base again because I felt 
that reinforcing the fundamentals would do me *a lot of good* 
in the long run. Especially as I head deeper into data science, 
getting confident with % change, ratios, and logic is ðŸ”‘.

ðŸ§® MATH SECTION â€“ PERCENTAGE CHANGE:

Formula Used:
    Percentage Change = (New - Old) / Old Ã— 100

Problems I solved:

  1. (2500 - 2000) / 2000 Ã— 100 = 25%
  2. (75 - 60) / 75 Ã— 100 = 20% decrease
  3. (45000 - 40000) / 40000 Ã— 100 = 12.5%
  4. (1000 - 25) / 25 Ã— 100 = 3900% 
     â–¸ 25 is the CP; 1000 is SP. That's 3900% profit.
     â–¸ Alternate: 25% of 1000 = 250 â†’ CP = 750

Notes:
    - % Increase â†’ new > old
    - % Decrease â†’ new < old
    - Very common in discounts, data growth, profit/loss

TABLEAU SECTION â€“ SETUP + FIRST LOOK:

Actions Completed:
  -> Installed Tableau Public
  -> Opened sample datasets (Superstore)
  -> Explored Dimensions vs Measures
  -> Created first blank worksheet
  -> Observed 'Show Me' chart suggestions

Key Tableau Concepts Learned:
  - Dimensions â†’ Qualitative data (e.g. Category, Region)
  - Measures â†’ Quantitative (e.g. Sales, Profit)
  - Worksheets â†’ Single visuals
  - Dashboards â†’ Combine visuals
  - Drag & drop â†’ Visualization is highly intuitive!

made some bascis charts too! the interface was easy to comprehend tomorrow we go harder!

ðŸ—£ REFLECTION:

Today was more about slowing down to go faster later.

I couldâ€™ve rushed into advanced data stuff, but rebuilding 
from the ground upâ€”math AND Tableauâ€”felt like sharpening my axe 
before cutting trees. I want my foundation solid as a rock.

ðŸš€ LET'S KEEP GOING.
