# 📅 Week 4 Recap — Tableau + Math Foundations

## Overview
Week 4 was focused on mastering **Tableau** while keeping up with **math foundations**.  
I took a short break during this week (briefly mentioned here) but came back strong with a more structured approach —  
splitting the learning into **Session 1** and **Session 2** instead of the usual "Day 23, 24, 25…" format.  
This helped me work more efficiently and complete Tableau faster without unnecessary fragmentation.

## Why Sessions Instead of Days?
Instead of spreading Tableau over 4–5 days, I condensed the learning into **two high-impact sessions**:
- **Session 1:** Focused on Tableau basics, connecting to data, and creating my first dashboard using Sample Superstore data.
- **Session 2:** Advanced dashboard building — KPI cards, maps, heatmaps, filters, interactive elements, and layout optimization.

This structure allowed me to complete Tableau in **2 sessions** while keeping my math practice separate.

## Key Tableau Skills Learned
- Connecting datasets and using **Sample Superstore** as the base.
- Creating **different chart types** (bar, line, tree map, map, heatmap, scatter plot, KPI cards).
- Using **filters, highlight actions, parameters** for interactivity.
- Designing **multi-sheet dashboards** with horizontal/vertical containers for perfect alignment.
- Sorting, coloring, and formatting visuals for maximum clarity.
- Publishing to **Tableau Public** for sharing with recruiters.
- Combining **storytelling with dashboards** to convey insights effectively.
