# Week 2 Big Project – E-Commerce Customer Insight Analysis

## Overview

This project simulates a real-world task where I was asked to analyze customer sales data for a fictional e-commerce company. The goal was to extract valuable business insights, segment customers, and present visual dashboards to stakeholders.

Everything here was built using only **Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn**.

## Business Objectives

The CEO of the company wanted to understand:

1. Who are our most valuable customers?
2. How does loyalty differ across regions?
3. Are there any hidden high-potential customers?
4. What months are our strongest for sales?
5. What email domains do our top customers use?
6. Are there differences across gender and product categories?
7. Can we build a visual dashboard that summarizes all of this?

## Key Insights

- **Elite-tier customers** tend to cluster in the [fill in actual top region from output] region.
- The highest total CLV occurred in **Month #[fill in]**, indicating a peak period worth marketing focus.
- Several **Gold-tier customers** actually qualify for Elite status — revealing untapped potential.
- **Gmail** and **Outlook** dominated the top customer email domains.
- A simple segmentation by `CLV` allowed for quick tier-based analysis and action.

## Personal Note

This project took time. It wasn’t easy. I got stuck, debugged, and rewrote large chunks. But it taught me how real data analysts think and work.

I’m **not perfect**, but I **adapt fast** and iterate even faster.

Every line of code here represents growth from where I started — and I’m just getting warmed up.

## Next Step

Week 3 → SQL + Dashboard building using real KPIs and stakeholder-style requests.

Stay tuned.
