# 📊 Day 3 Challenge – Player Stats Analyzer

This project is part of my **#Warpath28** journey to master Python Data Analysis using Pandas.  
In Day 3, we focus on filtering, sorting, mapping, and transformations in a real-world football player dataset.

## 🔍 Challenge Overview

We are given a dataset of 5 popular football players with attributes:
- Player name
- Club
- Goals scored
- Retirement status

### ✅ Tasks Performed:
1. Created a pandas DataFrame from scratch
2. Filtered **non-retired** players
3. Sorted players by **goals (descending)**
4. Categorized players into **tiers**:
   - `Legend` (≥ 700 goals)
   - `Star` (≥ 300 goals)
   - `Rising` (< 300 goals)
5. Mapped clubs to their **respective leagues**
6. Dropped unnecessary columns
7. Demonstrated use of **set/reset index**
8. Described goal stats with `.describe()`
